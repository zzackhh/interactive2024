    <p class="title">Welcome.</p>
    <p>I love technology. I was born in 2002, before the iPhone and the iPad. 
        But trust me, I grew up on the internet.
        I grew up in an interesting time, where tech was rapidly changing; 
        throughout my childhood, consoles came and went, 
        and devices like my 3DS-Game Boy hybrid or websites like Tumblr 
        fueled my creativity. This collection is a digital archive of 
        those relics of history that we might forget –– but are certainly 
        integral to many of our lives.
