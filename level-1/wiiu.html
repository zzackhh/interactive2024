        <h3>Nintendo Wii U (2012â€“2017)</h3>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/11/20/wii-u-review-part-one-first-impressions/">
                I set off on Sunday morning to purchase a brand new Wii U console. My first stop: Walmart. </a>
        </p>

        Upon arrival I was informed that I was too late. Nintendo's shiny new system had sold out earlier that morning.
        
        Best Buy would open in twenty minutes so I headed across town, where I found myself waiting in line outside in the cold.
        
        Fortunately, I was the fourth person in line. I say fortunately because soon after I arrived several other people showed up. There were some middle-aged folks, some kids, and many people in-between. It was like a miniature Black Friday..
