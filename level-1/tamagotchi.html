        <h1>Who even knows when I got a Tamagotchi?</h1>
        <h2>I loved them growing up<span> and had one hanging from my bulletin board.</h2>


        <p>Will Tamagotchi become a post-Beanie Babies craze? It's safe to say it's going to be successful, but we don't know yet if it will be a megasuccess. To be up there with Beanie Babies, kids will have to collect them.</p>

        <p>Gene Morra from Bandai America said a well-nurtured Tamagotchi can live about 30 days, but some in Japan have lasted nearly three months.</p>

        <p>For some children, it became frustrating. Ilyssa, 9, said it was fun at first, but now it beeps constantly. "I want it to die," she said. "It's driving me crazy."</p>

        <p>Teenagers like Courtney, 13, also found it overwhelming. "It was like taking care of a real child," she said, after turning off the sound because it beeped every five minutes.</p>

        <p>Psychologists say the toy teaches responsibility, and Bandai plans to release an improved version with a 'pause' button soon.</p>
