 	<span style="color:black;"> Will Tamagotchi become a post-Beanie Babies craze? ''It's safe to say it's going to be very successful, but we don't know yet if it's going to be a megasuccess,'' said Sean McGowan of Gerard Klauer Mattison, a securities research and brokerage firm in Manhattan. ''To be up there with Beanie Babies, kids will have to collect them.'' (The Tamagotchi is on a key ring, another hot item with schoolchildren.)

Gene Morra, the vice president of marketing for Bandai America, in Cypress, Calif., said a carefully nurtured Tamagotchi can ''live'' about 30 days, but in Japan some are said to have lasted nearly three months.

Dr. Cohen called Tamagotchi a breakthrough of sorts. ''It's the most powerful product I've ever heard of, in terms of what it demands from a child,'' he said. ''I never heard of a toy that makes you stay engaged with it all the time.''

But some children get disillusioned. In the beginning, said Ilyssa Meren, 9, a third grader in Manhattan at the Nightingale-Bamford School (which has also banned Tamagotchi), the toy was easy to take care of. But now it beeps constantly, and one morning it woke her at 4 A.M. ''I want it to die,'' she said. ''It's driving me crazy.'' But Ilyssa will not commit virtual murder. ''When it dies, I won't reset it,'' she said.

Courtney Glickman, 13, also said it was too much. ''It beeped every five minutes and was getting on my nerves, so I turned off the sound,'' she said, not seeming at all sad that her pet sprouted wings one day.

''It was too much work -- like a real child,'' her mother said.

But psychologists say that for a teen-ager, Tamagotchi-style parental responsibility can be an effective learning experience.

Some high schools around the country already teach how demanding a baby can be by giving teen-agers real eggs to carry around for a week: the egg must go everywhere, and it is the student's job to make sure it doesn't break.

''I can see the Tamagotchi as a teaching tool about pregnancy for young women and men,'' Dr. Rimm said. ''It could help them understand reality.''

Meanwhile, Bandai says it is coming out with a new improved Tamagotchi in the fall: it will have a ''pause'' button.
