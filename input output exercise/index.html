    <p>INT. THRIFT TOWN. DAY. Marion and Lady Bird are looking for a prom dress. Lady Bird is in the dressing room trying things on.</p>
    <p>MARION (sadly) I guess you won’t be going to dances in college. This is our last one. (then) You know, Davis has a terrific theatre. If you’re still interested in theatre. Are you?</p>
    <p>Lady Bird comes out in a dress, it’s too tight:</p>
    <p>LADY BIRD I’m probably no good at acting. (looking at herself) Why don’t I look like the girls in the magazines?</p>
    <p>MARION It’s too bad I can’t meet this Kyle before prom.</p>
    <p>LADY BIRD He’s not my boyfriend anymore. I mean, maybe he never even was.</p>
    <p>MARION I’d still like to meet him.</p>
    <p>LADY BIRD (O.S.) (re: the dress) IT’S TOO TIGHT! FUCK.</p>
    <p>Lady Bird goes back into the dressing room.</p>
    <p>MARION I suggested you not take that second helping of pasta...</p>
    <p>LADY BIRD MOM!</p>
    <p>MARION (innocent) Honey, you seem upset about it, I’m trying to help you.</p>
    <p>LADY BIRD Mom! You’re giving me an eating disorder!</p>
    <p>LADY BIRD (CONT’D) (to herself) I wish I could get an eating disorder.</p>
    <p>Lady Bird comes out again. The dress kind of fits her. It’s bright pink and frilly. She looks happy:</p>
    <p>LADY BIRD (CONT’D) I love it.</p>
    <p>Smiles up at her Mom, looking for approval:</p>
    <p>MARION (considering) Is it too pink?</p>
    <p>Lady Bird silently goes back into the dressing room. Her Mom just crushed something that she liked and was very “her.” Marion picks up that she’s upset:</p>
    <p>MARION (CONT’D) What?</p>
    <p>LADY BIRD (O.S.) Why can’t you say I look nice?</p>
    <p>MARION I thought you didn’t even care what I think.</p>
    <p>LADY BIRD (O.S.) I still want you to think I look good.</p>
    <p>MARION I’m sorry, I was telling you the truth. Do you want me to lie?</p>
    <p>LADY BIRD (O.S.) No, I just wish... I wish that you liked me.</p>
    <p>MARION Of course I love you.</p>
    <p>Lady Bird comes out. Looks at Marion with the pure question:</p>
    <p>LADY BIRD But do you like me?</p>
    <p>MARION (faltering) ...I want you to be the very best version of yourself you can be.</p>
    <p>LADY BIRD What if this is the best version?</p>
